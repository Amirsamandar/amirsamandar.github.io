My name is Amirhossein Samandar. I am a researcher and PhD candidate at **Case Western Reserve University (CWRU)**, set to earn my Master‚Äôs in Physics this Fall 2025. My academic journey began with a B.Sc. in Physics from Sharif University of Technology, where I built a strong foundation in theoretical physics. On a personal note, U.S. travel restrictions on Iranian citizens have prevented my wife from joining me here, motivating me to seek opportunities in Europe where we can reunite while I advance my career

As part of the **COMPACT collaboration**, I‚Äôve published five cosmology papers and developed **CMBtopology**, an HPC Python package for Cosmic Microwave Background covariance matrices in compact Euclidean topologies. I now apply this expertise to Large Language Models (LLMs), developing a Bayesian evaluation framework (**"Don't Pass@k"**, under review at ICLR 2026), optimizing models with asymmetric KV-cache quantization and lossless compression, and contributing to the **ReasoningBench** benchmark. I‚Äôm also exploring diffusion models for LLM noise modeling, including brain wave applications.

- üìä Bayesian analysis of Planck CMB data to constrain cosmic topology.
- ü§ñ Machine learning classification of non-trivial universe topologies using CMB simulated data.
- üìà A novel Bayesian evaluation framework for LLMs, "Don‚Äôt Pass@k: A Bayesian Framework for Large Language Model Evaluation" (under review at ICLR 2026, [arXiv:2510.04265](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04265) [cs.AI]).
- üõ†Ô∏è Development of [Bayes-Kit](https://github.com/Amirsamandar/bayes-kit), an open-source Python and Julia toolkit for uncertainty-aware evaluation of sampling decodings in LLMs.
- üìö Publications in Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics, including: ([arXiv:2510.05030](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05030), [arXiv:2407.09400](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09400), [arXiv:2503.08671](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08671), [arXiv:2404.01236](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01236), [arXiv:2409.02226](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02226)).

Research in AI
======
I apply statistical and computational methods to advance large language models (LLMs):
- üìà A novel Bayesian evaluation framework for LLMs, "Don't Pass@k," robust for fewer trials and reducing computational costs (under review at ICLR 2026, [arXiv:2510.04265](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04265)).
- üõ†Ô∏è Co-developed Bayes-Kit, an open-source Python and Julia toolkit for uncertainty-aware evaluation of sampling decodings (GitHub: [https://github.com/Amirsamandar/bayes-kit](https://github.com/Amirsamandar/bayes-kit)).
- üîÑ Contributed to asymmetric KV-cache quantization for LLMs, optimizing bit allocation for efficiency on resource-constrained hardware (anonymous ACL submission).
- üì¶ Worked on lossless compression techniques using Huffman coding, achieving 30% model size reduction ([arXiv:2504.11651](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11651)).
- üöÄ Extending compression and quantization methods with Bayesian frameworks for GPU algorithms and large-scale training optimizations (forthcoming paper).
- ‚öôÔ∏è Contributed to ReasoningBench, a benchmark assessing reasoning capabilities in LLMs (foundation, fine-tuned, reinforcement learning, and hybrid models) across math, science, IFEval, and code tasks, analyzing sampling strategies and inference-time/post-training impacts.


Research in COMPACT
======
As part of the COMPACT collaboration (Case Western Reserve, Pittsburgh, Imperial College London, IFT Madrid):
- üåå Explored signatures of non-trivial topology in CMB anisotropies, computing temperature and polarization correlation functions.
- üìö Published five papers on cosmic topology, including eigenmodes of non-orientable manifolds, parity violation without parity-violating microphysics, spin-2 perturbations, machine learning classification of toroidal universes, and limits on lens spaces.
- üìä Applied Bayesian likelihood analysis to Planck PR4 data, improving constraints from prior studies.
- üîß Developed efficient GPU-parallelized code for CMB covariance matrices and trained variational autoencoders as likelihood emulators.
- ü§ù Recently initiated collaboration with LiteBIRD to develop pipelines for cosmic topology analysis in CMB polarization studies.
